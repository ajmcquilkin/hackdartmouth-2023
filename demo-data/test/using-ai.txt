35 Ways Real People Are Using A.I. Right Now  April 14, 2023  “It’s like collaborating with an alien.”    “Everything is becoming much easier.”    “It feels like I’ve hired an intern.”    “What used to take me around a half-hour to write now takes one minute.”    “It’s enormous fun.”    The public release of ChatGPT last fall kicked off a wave of interest in artificial intelligence. A.I. models have since snaked their way into many people’s everyday lives. Despite their flaws, ChatGPT and other A.I. tools are helping people to save time at work, to code without knowing how to code, to make daily life easier or just to have fun.    It goes beyond everyday fiddling: In the last few years, companies and scholars have started to use A.I. to supercharge work they could never have imagined, designing new molecules with the help of an algorithm or building alien-like spaceship parts.    Here’s how 35 real people are using A.I. for work, life, play and procrastination.    People are using A.I to …    Plan gardens.    John Pritzlaff Gardener    Mr. Pritzlaff is building a permaculture garden in his backyard in Phoenix, where he uses drought-resistant trees to give shade to other species.    “I do these ultra-high-density planting arrangements,” he said. “And I’ve been employing ChatGPT to give me inspiration on species that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred to me, and for choosing the site for each tree: the best part of the yard with regard to the sun at different times of the year.”    Taking into account his geographical location, it suggested, for example, that he might use a moringa tree to provide shade for a star apple.    Plan workouts.    Louis Maddox Data scientist    Mr. Maddox finds ChatGPT the perfect companion for his workouts. For example, one day he pasted in his workout notes and said:    Give a concisely formatted summary of this workout and the muscle groups activated. Note any muscle groups that were missed and suggest how to cover them with extras/replacements.    After summarizing the notes, ChatGPT said:    Missed Muscle Groups & Suggestions:   Quadriceps: Add leg press, squats or lunges.   Calves: Add standing or seated calf raises.   Glute Activation: Consider adding glute bridges or hip thrusts for better glute focus.    From there he asked ChatGPT what to prioritize if he didn’t have much time for the gym, and to sketch out roughly how long it might all take.    It’s not perfect, he says, but it gets the job done. Mostly, he says, ChatGPT helps him get going under time constraints, and not let the busywork “become an excuse not to do it.”    Plan meals.    Kelsey Szemborski Stay-at-home mother of three    Ms. Szemborski is a busy mom who is “always on the lookout for something that will make my life easier.” So when she found ChatGPT, she tried asking it for a gluten-free meal plan. And she added:    It needs to be both budget-friendly and also kid-friendly for kids who are picky eaters and we need to avoid peanuts. Please include a grocery list. Thank you!    And ChatGPT obliged. Here’s the first day of a week’s meals:    Breakfast: Gluten-free oatmeal with banana and honey   Snack: Fresh fruit (apples, bananas, oranges)   Lunch: Grilled cheese sandwich on gluten-free bread with tomato soup   Snack: Gluten-free crackers with hummus   Dinner: Slow-cooked beef stew with gluten-free biscuits    “It completely eliminated my normal meal-planning process that involved searching for recipes, trying to think of meal ideas, configuring a list of all of those ideas, and then making a list of the ingredients I need, too.”    Make a gift.    Matt Strain Technology and innovation consultant    Mr. Strain used ChatGPT to create a custom book of cocktails based on the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine written in the style of the J. Peterman catalog. He took the idea further the next day, using DALL-E to generate images of the cocktails for the final book, which he gave to his girlfriend for Valentine’s Day.
